# React project - PINcolor
## Fun project about how else could work PIN code

### Features:
1. no numbers, just colors
2. hexadecimal code of chosen color is password

### Ideas for improvement:
1. For each circle make three colors, colors can't repeat in another circles
examples
- in the first circle there could be green, brown, red
- in the second circle there could be yellow, blue, orange
2. In each circle generate three colors randomly
**If in particular circle** there are green, brown, red it will generate colors randomly, for example:
- first time you open PINcolor - green, brown, red
- second time you open PINcolor - brown, red, green
- third time you open PINcolor - red, green, brow
- etc.
